Examples of tools include JUnit (Java), NUnit (.NET), pytest (Python), etc.

2. Integration Testing

It focuses on Interaction between integrated units or components where Developers or testers Validate that combined units work together as expected. It's based on different approaches such as:
Top-down: Testing starts from the top of the module hierarchy and progresses to the lower levels.
Bottom-up: Testing starts from the bottom of the hierarchy and progresses to the upper levels.
Big Bang: All units are integrated and tested at once.
Incremental: Units are integrated and tested step-by-step.

3. System Testing
It focuses on the complete and integrated software performed by testers who validate that the system as a whole meets the specified requirements. It's further classified into: Functional testing, performance testing, security testing, usability testing, etc.

4. Acceptance Testing
It focuses on the final validation before the software is delivered to the end-user performed by end-users who validate that the software meets the business requirements and is ready for deployment.
it's is further classified into; User Acceptance Testing (UAT): Conducted by the end-users to ensure the system meets their needs.
Operational Acceptance Testing (OAT): Ensures the software can be deployed and operated in its target environment.

Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.

Version control systems (VCS) are software tools that help manage changes to source code and other files associated with a project. 

Importance of Version Control Systems:
